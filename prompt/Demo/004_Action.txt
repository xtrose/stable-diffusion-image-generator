drifting in a long curve in the city and white smoke comes out the back wheels
drifting in a long curve in the country and dust comes out the back wheels
in a race with other muscle cars they were all in back
jumps over a construction site with many dust
drives through a large glass pane and shards fly everywhere
jumps out a building windows and shards fly everywhere
drives into peoples and they fly away
